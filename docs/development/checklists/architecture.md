## Milestone 0 acceptance criterion

> The architecture must support adding a new FFmpeg operation without requiring changes to the CLI infrastructure or execution layer.

**Satisfied by design:** commands are adapters over typed domain operations; domain operations emit structured FFmpeg invocations consumed by a shared runtime. New operations register under a domain without changing process execution, JSON output, logging, overwrite handling, or error semantics.

## Gate to Milestone 1

Milestone 1 may start when implementation conforms to the frozen decisions here. Any incompatible change requires an ADR/update to this package rather than an implicit deviation.
