# Pipeline & Preset System

Milestone 18 introduces a declarative orchestration layer above the existing typed media domains.

## Boundary

    +--> convertFile

            v

```

The pipeline layer never imports `node:child_process` and never shells out to the CLI.

## Relative paths

The pipeline file directory is the declarative job root. Relative `input` and `output.path` values resolve from that directory. CLI `--output` is resolved by the CLI before it reaches the executor.

## Intermediate media

Actual multi-step jobs allocate one `TemporaryWorkspace`. Every non-final step receives a unique output path in that workspace. Domain functions still use their own transactional sibling temp files for each individual transform.

The workspace is removed in `finally` unless `keepTemp` is explicit.

## Dry-run

Domain dry-runs cannot be chained because a later step would need an intermediate file that was intentionally not created. Pipeline dry-run therefore operates one level higher: it validates the source, schema, preset expansion, output contract, and ordered step plan without invoking mutating domain operations.

## Presets

Presets are local named arrays of pipeline steps. Expansion is recursive and deterministic. A recursion stack detects cycles before execution.

## Output contract

`output.codec` is an optional assertion. The validator also checks the final `convert.to` / `resize.to` against the final extension.

## Public API

The package root exports the full `src/pipeline/` API, including parser, schemas, preset expansion, validation, and execution.
