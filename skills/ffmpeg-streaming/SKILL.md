# FFmpeg Streaming

Use this skill for live capture and network media delivery.

## Activation scope

Use for:

- camera capture from V4L2, AVFoundation, or DirectShow;
- streaming a media file at playback rate;
- HTTP(S), RTMP(S), RTSP, SRT, UDP, or TCP destinations;
- choosing a transport-appropriate muxer and low-latency encoding.

## Do not use

Do not claim direct WebSocket support. If browser clients need WebSocket, model an explicit relay service. Do not use file-output transactional semantics for live network destinations.

## Required inputs

Identify:

- source kind: camera or file;
- camera device and capture backend when applicable;
- destination URL;
- transport/container when not inferable;
- video/audio codec policy;
- bitrate/GOP/preset constraints.

## Preflight

For file sources, probe before streaming. For camera sources, use `--dry-run` to validate the planned invocation without opening the device.

## Toolkit surface selection

Streaming is not exposed through the v1.2 MCP tool catalog.

1. Use the global `cecilia-ffmpeg` binary for supported streaming and capture operations.
2. If the global binary is unavailable, use:
   `npm exec --yes --package=@cecilialabs/ffmpeg -- cecilia-ffmpeg <command>`.
3. Do not invent an MCP streaming tool.
4. Use native FFmpeg only for unsupported streaming features or an explicit native-command request.

## Preferred toolkit commands

```bash
cecilia-ffmpeg stream camera --device <device> --url <url>
cecilia-ffmpeg stream file <input> --url <url>
```

Supported direct transport families: HTTP(S), RTMP(S), RTSP, SRT, UDP, TCP.

For supported operations, prefer the toolkit surface selected above over constructing arbitrary FFmpeg shell commands.

## Native FFmpeg fallback

Use native FFmpeg only for unsupported streaming features or explicit user requests. Maintain strict separation between input capture format, media encoding, muxer/container, and network transport.

## Output expectations

A dry run should expose the complete plan without opening sockets. A live run remains active until input completion, receiver failure, or cancellation.

## Validation

Validate URL scheme/transport agreement, muxer compatibility, encoder availability, and receiver expectations. For network problems, distinguish FFmpeg encoding failure from receiver/connectivity failure.

## Error recovery

- For a `ws://`/`wss://` destination, require an explicit relay architecture.
- For RTMP use FLV; for RTSP use the RTSP muxer; for generic HTTP/SRT/UDP/TCP use MPEG-TS in the current toolkit.
- If a receiver rejects the stream, verify its expected codec/container and listening mode.
- If a camera cannot open, verify device path/name, capture backend, permissions, and supported mode.

## Safety and determinism

Never expose credentials embedded in streaming URLs in unnecessary logs. Use cancellation through the shared runtime; do not kill unrelated FFmpeg processes.
