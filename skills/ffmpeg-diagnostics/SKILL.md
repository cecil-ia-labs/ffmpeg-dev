# FFmpeg Diagnostics

Use this skill when the media or FFmpeg operation is failing and the defect must be identified before repair.

## Activation scope

Use for:

- PTS/DTS or non-monotonic timestamp errors;
- timebase/FPS/CFR/VFR problems;
- corrupt packets or decode errors;
- stream mapping failures;
- filter graph reinitialization failures;
- frozen frames;
- unexpected missing streams;
- codec/container/pixel-format compatibility issues.

## Do not use

Do not apply repair profiles blindly to healthy media. Do not use a generic re-encode as the first response when the toolkit can diagnose the observed defect.

## Required inputs

Collect:

- failing media path;
- FFmpeg stderr/log when available;
- whether deeper freeze detection is needed;
- desired output constraints if repair is requested.

## Preflight workflow

1. Run:
   `cecilia-ffmpeg diagnose <input> --json`.
2. If the user supplied an FFmpeg log, include it with `--log`.
3. Use `--deep` only when freeze analysis is relevant.
4. Choose a repair based on observed issues.

## Preferred toolkit commands

```bash
cecilia-ffmpeg diagnose <input>
cecilia-ffmpeg repair timestamps <input>
cecilia-ffmpeg repair normalize <input>
```

For supported operations, prefer `npx @cecilialabs/ffmpeg ...` over constructing arbitrary FFmpeg shell commands.

## Native FFmpeg fallback

Use native FFmpeg only for unsupported repair cases or when explicitly requested. Preserve the diagnosis and explain what the fallback is intended to fix.

## Output expectations

Diagnostics should identify issue codes/severity and supporting observations. Repair reports should include before/after diagnostics when execution completes.

## Validation

After repair:

1. FFprobe the output.
2. Re-run diagnosis.
3. Verify requested normalized properties.
4. Do not declare success solely because FFmpeg returned exit code 0.

## Error recovery

- Non-monotonic timestamps: prefer timestamp repair/normalization.
- FPS/timebase mismatch: normalize timing before composition.
- Filter graph error: inspect input properties and filter requirements rather than repeatedly re-running.
- Stream mapping error: verify actual streams with FFprobe.
- Corrupt decode: preserve evidence and avoid misleading “fixed” claims when source damage remains.

## Safety and determinism

Repairs write to a new transactional output. Never overwrite the source implicitly. Diagnosis is read-only.
